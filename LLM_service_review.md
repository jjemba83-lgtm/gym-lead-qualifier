LLM Service & Pydantic Integration Review
=========================================

Score: 8 / 10

Summary
-------
You achieved the core goals: Pydantic schemas, integration with instructor, and a standardized approach for LLM calls are present and largely working. The project now has typed models, prompt initialization, and a single LLM service that can be configured to use different providers through a single client interface.

What was completed
------------------
- Pydantic schema types for intents and outcomes in `leads/schemas.py`.
- Instructor-based client patching in `LLMService` so providers are swappable.
- Standardized LLM callsite patterns (response_model used for structured responses).
- `prospect_service.update_conversation_intent` made robust using `parse_obj`.
- Prompt loading with a management command `initialize_prompts` and defensive JSON parsing for closing prompts.
- Added `OUTCOME_CHOICES` and `INTENT_CHOICES` to `Conversation` so Django provides human-friendly labels.

Remaining gaps (why they matter)
---------------------------------
1. Response normalization consistency
   - `generate_response` currently returns the raw client response (model/dict). Callers may expect plain strings. Centralize normalization into a helper so DB fields and callers always receive predictable types.

2. Centralized response extractor/helper
   - Add `extract_text_from_response(raw_response)` to consistently pull a string from model/dict/choice shapes.

3. Prompt validation & logging
   - Validate all prompts (not just closing) at load time and log clear errors; ensure admin/seeded prompts are valid.

4. Tests and CI
   - Add unit tests for parsing/normalization and the management command to ensure behavior across provider shapes.

5. Error handling & tracebacks
   - Use `logger.exception(...)` when re-raising or when you want stack traces in logs.

6. Type/contract consistency
   - Decide whether LLM methods return `(str, provider)` or `(PydanticModel, provider)` and enforce it. Prefer normalizing to `(str, provider)` for storage.

7. Minor improvements
   - Limit conversation history sent to LLM and ensure ordering.
   - Remove or use unused variables (e.g., `config = SystemConfig.load()` where unused).

Priority next steps (recommended)
---------------------------------
1. Implement a single `extract_text_from_response(raw)` utility used by both `generate_response` and `generate_closing_message`.
2. Normalize `generate_response` to return `(string, provider)` consistently.
3. Add unit tests that mock different LLM client shapes and assert normalized outputs.
4. Replace key `logger.error(...)` uses with `logger.exception(...)` where stack traces will help debug.
5. Add prompt validation for `CONVERSATION_ASSESSMENT_PROMPT` and other prompts at import time.

Quick commands to generate a PDF locally
---------------------------------------
Use one of these options from PowerShell in your project root.

Option A — pandoc (recommended if installed):
```powershell
# Requires pandoc
pandoc LLM_service_review.md -o LLM_service_review.pdf
```

Option B — wkhtmltopdf (from generated HTML):
```powershell
# First open the HTML in a browser or use wkhtmltopdf to convert
wkhtmltopdf LLM_service_review.html LLM_service_review.pdf
```

Option C — Chrome headless (if you have Chrome/Edge installed):
```powershell
# Use the installed Chrome/Edge to print HTML to PDF
# Replace 'chrome' with the path to your Chrome/Edge executable if needed
chrome --headless --disable-gpu --print-to-pdf="LLM_service_review.pdf" "file:///${PWD}/LLM_service_review.html"
```

Files added to the workspace
---------------------------
- `LLM_service_review.md` — human-readable review and recommendations (this file)
- `LLM_service_review.html` — rendered HTML version (for direct PDF printing)

If you want, I can also:
- Create a PDF inside the workspace (needs a converter available on the runner), or
- Implement the `extract_text_from_response` helper and normalize `generate_response` and `generate_closing_message` for you.
